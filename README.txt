## Rules:
 1. Although this is code that you may copy and paste, don't plagiarize it!
 2. Use this code as a leaning tool
 3. You break the rules, you take responsibility for it.

## About:
  Everyone has different approaches to learning code. For me coding is very hard, and sometimes
  I cannot understand how it works no matter how much I try. here you might find answers to some
  of those questions.

## About me:
  I love coding in java, but I'm not an expert by any means. As much as I would like to be the next
  [Jon Skeet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet). I started my coding career at a very
  late stage in the game, and I struggled a lot to learn what most already knew by heart, so once I
  was done with my intro classes I decided to become a lab assistant in order to help those in my
  same position. I don't think that giving someone the answer to their question will harm them; on
  the contrary, I think it can help them clarify something they don't know without having to read for
  hours the same three paragraph ofa textbook that everyone gets. If you’re anything like me, you
  probably will end up in my kind of situation:

    -You probably will go to google and spending countless hours on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for answers with crazy terminology;
    -Then   you will start looking for the [crazy terminology](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/glossary-135216.html) and slowly transcribe the Stack Overflow text;
    -Then realize  that now that you understand the topic better, you don't agree/need that answer...
    -And back onto the loop.

  In a way, If you’re anything like me, it took you one hour to read up to here, because you didn’t
  know what Stack Overflow was, or maybe you looked up Jon Skeet, or maybe you looked up who [I](https://xkcd.com/1024/)
  was because you were skeptical of my abilities (to expedite the process… I’m a novice at what I do).
  Point is, I wanna provide those like me with the tools to learn, and save them the loop process.
  Yes that process might be helpful for knowledge, but some other times it can be harmful, and even
  discouraging.  Anyhow, I also wanna take this as an opportunity for those who know more than me
  to show off their skills and help others in the process. Thank you for reading :)

## Have a Question ?
  -Create an issue:
    -Describe the issue as much as possible.
    -Give me a link with the stack Overflow.
    -Attach your github link and point me to the code (prefer if the code commented).
  -Ask me in person.
  -Send me an email:
    -quirogas@mail.gvus.edu
  -Pray to the goods of stack Overflow .

## Sugestiong
  -Email me.
  -Tell me in person.
  -Find the most convenient way for you to tell me.
  -Hope that Physics allow for us to synchronise through some form of quatum entanglement through.
  -Create a BCI that allow me to do actually sync our thoughts.

## Slack
  Wile not the most UX compatible website, I find slack to be a great place to share knowledge on the topic.
  CIS 999 is a place where that is possible, but i'm not quite an admin, just a fanboy, so I have to send them your
  email address, and wait for their bureaucrats to take you in.
